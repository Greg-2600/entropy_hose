Multithreaded random number generator in bash

To satiate my own curiosity, I was interested in testing a theory that Matt Blaze spoke about.
With the amount of imbeded, virtualized, containerized, etcetera environments out there... 
Is it possible to create arbitrarily random numbers without access to a hardware clock?
